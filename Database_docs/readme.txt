Unfortunately, due to the external pressures of the pandemic and personal tragedies, we were never able to get a full implementation of a database server.

What we've provided here are some documents that should show the way the database design was building, including an ER diagram and relation schema for the classes we would have tried to implement. The intent was to have a full separate server on a home computer which the QuizMaker product would have been able to interact with, allowing logins and remote storage of questions and answers.

We ended up utilizing Javascript's local storage functions in the program itself.
